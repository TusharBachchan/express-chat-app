# Chat App README

Welcome to our Chat App! This README provides an overview of how the chat functionality works.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow the steps below:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the server:

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

4. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/chat` to access the chat room.

## Functionality Overview

### 1. Creating User Sockets

- As soon as a user enters the "/chat" page, a socket is created for them. This socket establishes a real-time connection between the user's browser and the server.

### 2. Joining a Room

- Upon creating the socket, the user's socket is automatically joined to a specific chat room. This enables the user to communicate with others who are also in the same room.

### 3. Emitting Join Messages

- When a user joins the room, a message is automatically emitted to the chat room, notifying other users that "{user}" has joined. The "{user}" placeholder is replaced with the actual username or identifier of the user who joined.

### 4. Handling User Sent Messages

- The chat app provides a user-friendly interface for typing and sending messages. When a user sends a message, it is transmitted through their socket to the server, which then broadcasts the message to all other users in the same room. The server ensures that the message is delivered in real-time to maintain a dynamic chat experience.

### 5. Handling Received Messages

- When a user receives a message from another user in the same chat room, the message is displayed in real-time on their chat interface. This allows users to engage in conversations and stay updated with the ongoing discussions within the room.
